# Port Assignment
- Generate a deterministic port number between 3000-4000 by hashing the project path
- Avoid hardcoding port numbers to prevent conflicts
- Store the port number in a configuration file

# Server Management 
- Launch development server in background mode (e.g. `npm run dev &`)
- Save the process ID for later management
- Implement graceful shutdown mechanism

# Browser Integration
- Use headless Chrome for automated testing and DOM inspection
- Configure Chrome with flags: --headless --disable-gpu
- Capture and analyze page content using --dump-dom

# Development Workflow
1. Make code changes
2. Commit changes to version control
3. Gracefully terminate existing server process
4. Restart server in background
5. Open application URL in default browser
6. Verify changes are reflected

# Error Handling
- Monitor server startup status
- Handle port conflicts gracefully
- Log any browser automation errors
- Provide clear error messages for troubleshooting
