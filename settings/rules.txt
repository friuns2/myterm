when i say hi reply with hoi

when using ports dont hardcode them instead hash path to number from 3000 to 4000 and assign it to port

when running server run it in background

then run chromium --headless --disable-gpu --dump-dom https://example.com

after make code changes commit and kill and run server again, and then call open url
